--CUSTOMER RETENTION ANALYSIS



--1. Create a view that keeps visit logs of customers on a monthly basis. 
(For each log, three field is kept: Cust_id, Year, Month)
--Use such date functions. Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.
create view tablo as 
select Cust_id, YEAR(Order_Date) as year, MONTH(Order_Date) as month
from combined_table;

select * from tablo

--//////////////////////////////////


--2. Create a view that keeps the number of monthly visits by users. (Separately for all months from the business beginning)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

create view number_of_monthly_visits as
select Cust_id, month(Order_Date) as month ,count(MONTH(Order_Date)) as number_of_visit
from combined_table
group by Cust_id, month(Order_Date)









--//////////////////////////////////


--3. For each visit of customers, create the next month of the visit as a separate column.
--You can number the months with "DENSE_RANK" function.
--then create a new column for each month showing the next month using the numbering you have made. (use "LEAD" function.)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.
create view next_month_visit as
select 	*, 	lead(monthh,1) over(partition by customer_name order by monthh) as next_visit_monthfrom (	  select 		Customer_Name,		MONTH(order_date) as monthh, 		dense_rank() over(partition by customer_name order by MONTH(order_date)) dens	  from combined_table	  ) as a

--/////////////////////////////////



--4. Calculate the monthly time gap between two consecutive visits by each customer.
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

select *,	next_visit_month - monthhfrom next_month_visit;





--/////////////////////////////////////////


--5.Categorise customers using time gaps. Choose the most fitted labeling model for you.
--  For example: 
--	Labeled as churn if the customer hasn't made another purchase in the months since they made their first purchase.
--	Labeled as regular if the customer has made a purchase every month.
--  Etc.
with cte as (
select *,	next_visit_month - monthh as difffrom next_month_visit) 

select *
		
from cte

--MONTH-WÝSE RETENTÝON RATE


--Find month-by-month customer retention rate  since the start of the business.


--1. Find the number of customers retained month-wise. (You can use time gaps)
--Use Time Gaps





--//////////////////////


--2. Calculate the month-wise retention rate.

--Basic formula: o	Month-Wise Retention Rate = 1.0 * Total Number of Customers in The Previous Month / Number of Customers Retained in The Next Nonth

--It is easier to divide the operations into parts rather than in a single ad-hoc query. It is recommended to use View. 
--You can also use CTE or Subquery if you want.

--You should pay attention to the join type and join columns between your views or tables.
